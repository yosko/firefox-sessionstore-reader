Firefox's sessionstore.js reader
=====

Display windows and tabs from Firefox's sessionstore.js in a readable way.

I personaly use this when Firefox can't restore the session after a crash to try and recover my tabs "manually" from the session store.

Implemented and used on Firefox Developper Edition Version 54.

## How to

Put the sessionstore.js next to the ```.php``` file on your web server, the access the script via its URL.

Simple as pie. :)
